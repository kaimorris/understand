			<i><b>Misconceptions</b></i>
			With every mental disability, there are common misconceptions made by onlookers who base their preconceived notions after surface level observations. These people do not know the extent of the effects caused by mental disabilities. Three of the misconceptions that people hold about social anxiety disorder, according to Bridges to Recovery, a distinguished licensed residential mental health care program, comprised of multiple licensed psychiatrist, psychologist, and psychotherapist, include “Social Anxiety Affects Only Public Speaking”, “Social Anxiety Can’t Actually Hurt You”, and “Social Anxiety and Nervousness Are the Same Thing”.  To rectify the first perception, social anxiety does not only affect public speaking, however, that is just one of the many effects of social anxiety. The following paragraphs, elucidates the two subtypes of social anxiety disorder; generalized and performance anxiety, along with resolving the conception that social anxiety can’t actually hurt the person living with it, and correcting the misconception that social anxiety and nervousness are the same thing.

			<i><b>Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder</b></i> 
			It is common nature for “outsiders” to think of generalized social anxiety in basic terms; many perceive the disorder to simply be “nervousness”, however, that is not the case. Seminar author Murray Stein from the University of California San Diego, describes generalized social anxiety as “the most disabling form of the disorder”. He then goes on to explain that the people with this disorder “can fear and avoid specific performance situations such as public speaking” however, “their social fears and avoidance extend far beyond that relatively common sphere of concern”.

			<i><b>Performance</b></i>
			Performance anxiety as described by Jonathan Berent, a psychotherapist who has been practicing  clinical work with thousands of individuals of all ages with social anxiety since 1978, includes “public speaking, informal and spontaneous speaking in public, performing arts, sports, social interaction, conversation, relationship development, and sexual activity”, therefore restricting those with it from participating in activities associated with and done in school and that “it becomes a disorder when avoidance (phobia) occurs and when the emotional or physical pain of anxiety becomes substantial”. Psychologist and PhD Student, Eric de Heer, at the Clinical Centre of Excellence for Body, Mind, and Health Tilburg, extends on the pain aspect of anxiety, claiming that it has a “negative impact on the prognosis of psychopathology and psychiatric treatment outcome”, thus “leading to more treatment resistance”. He goes on to explain that “pain may be a marker of a more difficult-to-treat disorder, [leading] to a longer time before remission”, therefore making it more difficult for a patient with anxiety to heal.</div>
