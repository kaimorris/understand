			<div class="hfainfo centertext"> After having several students complete a survey based on how much they know about Autism, specifically High Functioning Autism, it is evident that there is confusion about what autism is.
	Autism can be thought of as a large tree with many branches that grows from it. There are four branches of autism which are Asperger’s Syndrome, Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Autistic Disorder and Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. Along with the branches, there is also a spectrum; The left side of the spectrum being low functioning and the right side being high functioning.
Asperger’s Syndrome is a form of High Functioning Autism(also known as HFA). High Functioning Autism is a form of autism in which the person with HFA is “deemed to be cognitively higher functioning” than those with low functioning autism (Sanders). One’s cognitive level effects process of perception, memory, judgment, and reasoning so if a highly functioning autistic person shows a decent amount of the listed characteristics, it is easier for them to blend in with society but not totally(Haiste). 
Being the fact that Asperger’s Syndrome is a mental disorder, the brain setup should be explained. Everyone has a part of the brain known as the “amygdala”. This part of the brain controls one’s emotions and how they react in situations(Ahmad R. Harir). When one has Aspergers Syndrome, their amygdala doesn’t function correctly which causes them to either overreact or underreact in situations. Taking into consideration that those with AS have a different wiring in their brain, it is important to be patient when interacting with them and not take everything so personal.
